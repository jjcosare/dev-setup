# [Coursera - Functional Programming Fundamentals in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1)

> Base Project for Weekly Assignments : Setup

1. Please refer to `./coursera-progfun1` as base project

1. Copy the folder `./coursera-progfun1` on your desired location

1. Upload the contents of `coursera-progfun1` to your github repo

1. Import the project to intellij using `coursera-progfun1/build.sbt`

1. Note: `coursera-progfun1` is structured as a multi-module project but this is only used to resolve project detection by intellij's sbt plugin and hence we can't use the main project to `submit` answers to coursera

1. Using intellij's terminal, create new terminal 

> Change directory to your desired sub-project

```bash
cd w1-example
``` 
> Run sbt

```bash
sbt
``` 
> Submit your answer to coursera

```bash
submit {email} {token}
```
